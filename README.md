# US Airlines Flight Delays & Cancellations Analysis

This project explores 5.3M+ flight records from 2015 to uncover key insights on delays and cancellations across US airlines, airports, and routes. The goal was to understand patterns that impact passengers and airlines.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Flight delays and cancellations affect millions of travelers every year. Using Python, I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to answer key business questions like:

- Which airlines had the highest delays and cancellations?
- Which airports and routes were most impacted?
- Do delays differ by day of the week (weekdays vs weekends)?
- Are there any geographical patterns in delays?
